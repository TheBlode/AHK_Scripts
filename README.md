# AHK Scripts

## Introduction
These are a collection of old and new AHK (AutoHotKey) scripts that I have written primarily for myself but others may benefit from these aswell! I hope you enjoy them.

## Blind Mining
The Blind Mining project is an attempt at making Minecraft (Java Edition) playable for the blind.

## Suspend My PC
This script will suspend your PC (tested and works on Windows 7 and Windows 10 where suspending is supported). This script is useful if you want to setup a hotkey or shortcut to it without any command line actions.
